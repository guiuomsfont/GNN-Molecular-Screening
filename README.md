# GNN-Molecular-Screening
This work has been developed in the context of the research of candidate molecules using deep learning methodologies, in order to find some with some biologically required action. Therefore, Graph-based Neural Networks (GNN) have been explored in order to predict the free energies of an interaction between a molecule and a protein when they impact on the basis of the chemical structure of both. Different strategies have been studied to optimize the accuracy in order to obtain the ranking of candidates as reliable as possible. In particular, the problem has been applied to the search of drugs (active principle) that are available on the market and interact with some of the selected proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as a drug repurposing exercise applied to Covid- 19. The final aim is to provide the model with a protein and a set of molecules (drugs), to select those that will possibly interact based on the predictions made.
